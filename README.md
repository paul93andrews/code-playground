# Paul's Coding Playground

In this repository you'll find a lot of code that leads to nothing. Not nothing in the sense that I've gained nothing from it. I've learned a lot from the code here. But none of the code builds to any functional project - it doesn't amount to a whole. It's simply my practice playground.

Gathered here are my ongoing practice exercises, challenges, and overall random fun stuff done with code. It's like a CodePen for the public to see. The result is that much of the code you'll see is not the most beautiful nor the most efficient. But it works. And for someone learning the power of their code, that's all that matters. I'm learning how to make all of my work more beautiful and efficient as I go. This practice playground is an important step towards that.
