    //     ● Make a object to count occurences
    //     ● Thinking about edge cases
    //     ● What does the question want you to output, read it carefully, a string ? An object ?

            "k", "yes", "no", "no", "k", "yes"];

//         2: Assuming the following HTML, add functionality for an action to occur
//             when a user clicks on of the list items:
//             <ul id="todo-app">
//                 <li class="item">Walk the dog</li>
//                 <li class="item">Pay bills</li>
//                 <li class="item">Make dinner</li>
//                 <li class="item">Code for one hour</li>
//             </ul>
//             Your initial instinct here would probably be to attach event     listeners to each element with
// a class of .item.That’s a good solution! However, in an interview it would be best to
//             first ask the interviewer what the maximum number of elements the user can enter is.If it
//             can never be more than 10, for example, then attaching event listeners to each.item
//             would work fine.However, if there’s no limit to the number of items the user can enter,
//                 then you’d want to use a more efficient solution.
//             If your application could end up with hundreds of event listeners, the more efficient
//             solution would be to actually attach one event listener to the whole container, and then
//             be able to access each item when it’s actually clicked.This is called event delegation,
//                 and it’s much more efficient than attaching separate event handlers.
//                     Here’s the code for event delegation:

    document.addEventListener('DOMContentLoaded', function () {
        let app = document.getElementById('todo-app');
        // Attach event listener to whole container
        if (app) {
            app.addEventListener('click', function (e) {
                if (e.target && e.target.nodeName === 'li') {
    
                    let item = e.target;
                    alert('You clicked on item: ' + item.innerHTML);
                }
            });
        }
    });

    // Write a function that will loop through a list of integers and print the
    //     index of each element after a 3 second delay.
    //     The most common way of doing this today(with access to ES6 let and const
    //         variables) is like this:

    const arr = [10, 12, 15, 21];
    for (let i = 0; i < arr.length; i++) {
        setTimeout(function () {
            console.log('The index is ' + i);
        }, 3000);
    }

        'bcmp': 3,
